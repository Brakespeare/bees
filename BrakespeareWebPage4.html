	<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">My Name is Jacob Brakespeare, I am a 22 year old West Australian.<br>
	I am very proud of my mixed Race,<br> I can track my heritage all the way to the first nation peoples of The U.S & Canada,<br>From my African American forefathers on my fathers side,<br>
	 And to the First Europeans From Ireland and Sweden to Make Australia Their Home on my mothers Side.<br>
	This has lead me to learn more about the history of my ancestors and of various nations around the world,<br> I love history, the good, the bad, the Crazy and everything inbetween.<br>
	I also have a love for Movies, Books, Video games & Music,<br> all of which at somepoint in my life shaped me into who I am</p>

	<h1 style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">Why do i want to work in I.T.?</h1>
	<p>Every time I think about my dream field of work, I come to several possibilities,<br>
	which lead to an uncertainty, but I realised that all of them had one thing in common,<br>
	they were all included within the branches of IT. Whether it was video game development,<br>
	Sound design, online content creation or music production, they all had a solid grounding in the IT space.<br>
	As someone that hasnâ€™t had allot of job security, and injuries that prevent me from returning to the industries I had previously worked in,<br>
	I wanted to find something that would give me more stability, or at the very least More flexibility. And the answer for me was IT.</p>
